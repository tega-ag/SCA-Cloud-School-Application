# SCA-Cloud-School-Application

Hello there! This is a my techinical application into The She Code Africa cloud School (in partnership with Deimos Cloud) which is a 3months cohort-style, bootcamp program specifically targeted at ladies across Africa, looking to kick off or switch careers into the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) field. 


Techonolgies used: Textwrap, Terminal, Docker and Github

Process: I started by creating a Github repository called SCA Cloud School Application
Created an html link using Textwrap with the text: Welcome to SCA Cloud School Application and a file containing the server used (nginx) and html link.
Added both link and file to a document
To run a Nginx server on a Docker container, on the terminal, I use the command
docker pull nginx:alpine
docker build -t simple-nginx .
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 simple-nginx
To confirm it c
localhost:8080
Back to GitHub, I created a stable branch
Also, I made some changes to your Dockerfile so the webpage displays Welcome to SCA Cloud School Application , this is my first assessment
Then, commit these changes to the repo into a branch called feature and Merge the feature branch to the stable branch.


docker pull oghenetega/sample-nginx
